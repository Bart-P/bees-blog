# Who Am I?

Hey there! I’m Bart—a self-proclaimed geek who’s obsessed with all things tech, staying fit, and in love with building stuff others can use. 
On top of that, I’m the co-founder of two companies and currently knee-deep in building my third venture. 
Yeah, you could say I’m a bit of a workaholic—but I wouldn’t have it any other way.

I started this blog because I’ve got a ton of ideas, stories, and lessons I’ve been itching to share. 
For years, I’ve been inspired and educated by countless blogs and YouTube channels. 
Now, it’s my turn to give back—to inspire, teach, and entertain anyone willing to read or watch. 
Whether you’re here for tech tips, entrepreneurial advice, or just a laugh, welcome to my corner of the internet!

## A Glimpse Into My Journey

TODO - rework this
I didn’t take the traditional route—no fancy degrees here. I started out at a UPS warehouse, then a call center, 
and a few other detours before becoming a self-employed sales rep, selling POS (Point of Sale) materials.
Eventually, my business partner and I took over an e-commerce store selling electrical cables.
With zero experience, we nearly ran it into the ground, but we managed to turn it around.
Financially, it gave us the boost to start our POS agency—now my second business.
Both ventures have had their ups and downs (and near bankruptcies), but today, they support us comfortably.

My passion for tech started early. In school, a friend and I wrote a simple “virus” (a funny Windows login loop) and put it on the school computers.
Life took me in other directions, but in my thirties, I got back into programming. Now, I’m a self-taught enthusiast building web apps and connecting APIs,
always hungry to learn more.
