## Who I Am
I’m Bart—a Linux and tech enthusiast, open-source supporter, proud family man, and co-founder of two businesses, with a third side project that keeps me busy on the weekends.

## What I Do
From e-commerce to jumpstarting a POS agency, I’m all about turning ideas into thriving ventures. 
These days, I’m deep into coding and AI, constantly finding more to discover and create. 

## Why I’m Here
I’m here to share what I’ve learned, have some fun, teach a little, and keep learning along the way.
This blog is my way of inspiring, teaching, and entertaining anyone interested in tech, business, or balancing a chaotic life.

## My Background in a Nutshell
I didn’t take the traditional path—no fancy degree, just grit and self-teaching. From writing a 'virus' in school to coding web apps in my thirties, all while building two businesses, it’s been a wild ride.

## Call to Action
Stick around for tips, stories, and maybe a laugh or two. Let’s connect and learn together!
